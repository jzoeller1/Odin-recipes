    </ul>

      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>Ground nutmeg (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Assembled Lasagna</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>4 1/2 cups marinara sauce</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>2 (9 oz) packages dried lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>1 1/2 oz grated parmesan</li>
      <li>1/2 cup asiago</li>
      <li>3 oz grated mozzarella</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the ricotta filling: If using fresh spinach, set a large skillet
        over high heat. (If using thawed frozen spinach, skip to Step 2.) When
        hot, add 2 tablespoons oil and half the fresh spinach. Season with a
        pinch of salt and sauté to wilt. Cook until stems are tender, about 3
        minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet and allow to cool in a single layer.
        Repeat with remaining spinach.
      </li>
      <li>
        While spinach cools, combine ricotta, mozzarella, Parmesan, basil and a
        generous pinch of salt in a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taking handfuls of the cooled or thawed spinach, squeeze out as much
        water as possible, then chop finely and add to cheese mixture. Mix
        thoroughly, then taste and adjust seasoning for salt. (Filling makes
        about 6 cups.) Cover and set aside until ready to assemble lasagna.
        (Ricotta filling can be made 1 day in advance and refrigerated. Bring to
        room temperature before assembling lasagna.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the béchamel: Set a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over
        medium heat and add butter. Once butter has melted, whisk in flour,
        reduce heat to very low and cook for about 15 minutes, stirring
        regularly to prevent browning. After the mixture foams a bit, it will
        visibly transform — the butter will separate, the bubbles will reduce in
        size, and the mixture will look like freshly wet fine sand. Whisking
        vigorously, slowly pour in milk. Increase heat to medium and whisk until
        the mixture thickens, about 2 minutes. Add salt, pepper and nutmeg (if
        using) to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return heat to low. Continue cooking, whisking regularly, for 10 to 15
        minutes until the sauce is thick and smooth, with no raw flour flavor.
        Taste and adjust seasoning with salt. If béchamel is lumpy, strain
        through a fine sieve or purée with an immersion blender. (You’ll have
        about 3½ cups.) Press a piece of parchment or plastic against the
        surface of the sauce to prevent a skin from forming and set aside until
        ready to assemble lasagna. (Béchamel can be made up to 1 day in advance,
        covered directly and refrigerated. Return to room temperature before
        using.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the lasagna: Position the highest rack in the oven so that it
        sits about 6 inches below the top. Heat oven to 400 degrees.
      </li>
      <li>
        If tomato sauce, béchamel and ricotta filling are cold, bring to room
        temperature or warm them as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set a large pot of water over high heat. Cover and bring to a boil. Set
        a large colander in a baking dish and place near stove.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the boiling water generously with salt until it tastes like sea
        water. Carefully lay one sheet of pasta on the water’s surface. Let it
        be completely immersed in the boiling water, using a slotted spoon to
        gently it push down if needed, before adding the next sheet. Add two
        more pasta sheets in this way and cook for about 2 minutes, or until
        light in color, floppy in texture and completely cooked through. If
        pasta bubbles above the water's surface, use a slotted spoon to
        encourage it back in. Use a sieve to gently remove pasta from the water
        and into the prepared colander. Rinse under cold water until cool enough
        to handle, then begin assembly. Continue cooking, draining and rinsing
        pasta two or three sheets at a time as you assemble lasagna.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon about ¾ cup béchamel into a 9-by-13-inch metal, glass or ceramic
        baking pan, and use a rubber spatula or your hands to generously coat
        bottom and sides of pan with sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently squeezing any remaining water from the pasta, use two or three
        sheets to entirely cover the bottom of the pan with minimal overlap, and
        leave ends hanging over sides. (They’ll be helpful for sealing the top.)
        All four sides need not have overhang; two is plenty.
      </li>
      <li>
        Crumble about ⅓ of the ricotta mixture evenly over pasta to create
        foundation, then layer with sheets of pasta from edge to edge of pan.
        Use kitchen shears to help trim pasta to appropriate size and avoid
        overlap.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread about ⅓ of the tomato sauce over next layer and cover with pasta.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread about 1 cup béchamel evenly over next layer, sprinkle with ¼ cup
        grated Parmesan, and cover with pasta.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat with remaining layers: ricotta, tomato sauce, béchamel and
        Parmesan, ricotta, tomato sauce, béchamel and Parmesan, following each
        with a layer of pasta. (If using thicker noodles, you might not be able
        to fit 8 layers of noodles in the pan. If using store-bought or dried
        pasta, you can skip the noodle layer between the ricotta and tomato
        sauce as needed to prevent the lasagna from stretching higher than the
        top of the pan.)
      </li>
      <li>
        For the top, fold overhanging pasta over a whole sheet to create a
        sealed pasta layer, then spread with remaining béchamel. Gently cover
        lasagna with a piece of parchment and wrap tightly with foil. Place onto
        a baking sheet to catch any overflow and bake on prepared rack.
      </li>
      <li>
        After 40 minutes, pull lasagna from oven and carefully remove foil and
        parchment. Sprinkle with grated mozzarella and return to oven until
        golden brown and bubbling on surface, about 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow to cool for at least 15 minutes before slicing and serving.
        Leftover lasagna can be wrapped and refrigerated for up to 4 days. To
        freeze, bake 30 minutes but do not brown, then cool, and freeze for up
        to 4 weeks. Defrost, then sprinkle with mozzarella and bake uncovered at
        400 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes until golden brown and bubbling on
        surface.
